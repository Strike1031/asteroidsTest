###       This project is a project for the test!!!
         (Asteroids analyze with a specified period)

###       Long Description


Create a React application that uses the data from this API https://api.nasa.gov/ (Asteroids NeoWs), so that it will show the asteroids that are closest to the Earth.

The application must have a page where users can type in a specific period and the page will display the asteroids closest to the Earth for the specified period - in both tabular and graphic view. 

●	The graph must show the maximum diameter, speed and distance to Earth for each asteroid. We would suggest you use a bubble chart and visualise the asteroids’ speed and size on the axes, and reflect the diameter in the bubble’s size. 
●	The table must show id, name, maximum and minimum diameter for each asteroid. Upon click, each row should open a page that displays the dates on which the given asteroid was or will be closest to the Earth as well as the actual distance.
What we expect to receive
A link to a git repo with your work on the exercise and instructions how to run it. 

What is important for us
●	The application must look good on both mobile and desktop.
●	We must be able to get and share a link to each asteroid we like. 
●	A well-built tree of components.  
Notes
●	At https://api.nasa.gov/ you could find documentation for a few different APIs. “Asteroids - NeoWs” is the one that you should be looking for. 
●	In the API documentation page you could generate an API key that supports 1000 queries per hour.  
●	You could use whichever components library you decide or none at all. We usually fancy Bootstrap and Material UI. 
●	You are free to pick a chart library of your own choice.
